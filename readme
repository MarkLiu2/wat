A simple equalizer in C using FFT.

The goal of this equalizer is apply loop transformations, such as loop 
unrolling, loop unswitching, loop fission and loop fusion and improve the
performance.

To compile it, use:
        $ make
        or
        $ make opt 

Call "./wat help" or just ./wat to get help about parameters.

This equalizer works only with wav files.
The limitations are:
        16 bits, only.
        1 or 2 channels.

The sample rate should not be a problem.
